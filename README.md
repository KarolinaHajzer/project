Project with technologies such as Django, Python, BeautifulSoup4, HTML, CSS.
With library in Python, which is BeautifulSoup4 I'm parsing websites searching words that suggest that something is on sale. When a parser finds these words, he creates text file of lines where were these words. Then these informations are added into my website. 
Front - end of website is HTML,CSS.
Back - end is Django.
